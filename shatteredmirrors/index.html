	<p>Shattered Mirrors is a toy theater musical soap opera about kittens living in the city of Meowsburg. It was created by Sophia Hamilton, Mason Fidino, Sean Hughes and myself. It started as a puppet show we would perform live but we eventually decided to try and make a tv show out of it. This is the "pilot".</p>
