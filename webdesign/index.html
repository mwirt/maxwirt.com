	Web Design
</h2>
<p class="blog-text">
	I have been designing websites for a little over 3 years now and love it. There are so many websites that look the same, I'm always looking for ways to make a website stand out. I also fondly try to reference web design from the past, you could call it "lo-fi web design". That being said I also can make something that looks modern and professional. Currently I am designing a website for a real estate company, clothing boutique, and videographer/artist. I have a wide range of design skills and since everything is custom designed, you can get the exact look you want. All for very affordable rates!
